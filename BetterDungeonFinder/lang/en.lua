If the font size of dungeon in your language is ok, let it empty.
you can set it with my pre-made settings.
"BAFWinH3"  20KB size
"BAFWinH4"  18KB size default setting
"BAFWinH5"  15KB size

Or you can define your own font.
Take a look at https://wiki.esoui.com/Fonts

For example:
local MyFont = string.format(
      "$(%s)|$(KB_%s)|%s",    --you don't need to understand this
      fontStyle,              --like "MEDIUM_FONT" (it's more complex to use other fonts not provided by eso)
      fontSize,               --like 12
      fontWeight              --like "soft-shadow-thin"
    )
BAFFontSize = MyFont
